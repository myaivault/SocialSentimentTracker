🧠 SocialSentimentTracker
AI-Powered Multi-Platform Brand Sentiment Analysis & Daily Slack Reporting via n8n
📘 Overview

SocialSentimentTracker is an automated workflow built with n8n, designed to monitor your brand’s presence across major social media platforms — Facebook, Instagram, and X (Twitter).

It fetches your latest posts or mentions, analyzes audience sentiment using Google Gemini AI, stores insights in a Google Sheet, and sends a daily Slack summary to your team.

This project provides businesses and educators with a powerful no-code automation system for real-time brand sentiment tracking and team updates.

⚙️ Key Features

✅ Multi-Platform Monitoring — Fetches recent posts and mentions from Facebook, Instagram, and X (Twitter) using Graph and REST APIs.
✅ AI Sentiment Analysis — Uses Google Gemini to classify sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
✅ Google Sheet Logging — Automatically saves each analyzed mention/post with its timestamp, sentiment, and platform.
✅ Slack Reporting — Sends a neatly formatted daily summary report (via Slack bot) with sentiment breakdowns and top mentions.
✅ Full Automation — Runs automatically every day at 10:00 AM via an n8n Cron Trigger.
